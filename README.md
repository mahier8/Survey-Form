# My Survey Form
This project creates an opportunity for anyone who acesses this form to provide feedback for my portfolio page.   
***
### Why the project is useful
The survey is engulfed in a container, with an image set as the background. Different input tags are used within the form itself. The project therefore offers a diverse range of possiblities in terms of ways to collect information.
***
### How you can get started with the project
freeCodeCamp offers great resources which helped me get started, and the survey form is one of the neccessary projects to complete in the Responsive Web Design module.
***
### Where you can get help with the project
Help for completing the project is provided on YouTube by Dylan Israel, through his channel. 
***
### Who maintains and contributes to the project
I maintain the project by improving on the form's design.
